# React with TypeScript and MUI

This is a simple React application with TypeScript and MUI. It uses React Router for navigation and MUI for styling.

We will be using the following api: https://dummyjson.com/docs/recipes#recipes-single for the recipe page, and we will be doing this together.

## Tasks:

- [ v] Create a new page for the home page

- [ v] Correctly set the types for the api data - Ensure you use all of the data types
- [ v] Use MUI card component to display the products and style it
