# React with TypeScript and MUI

This is a simple React application with TypeScript and MUI. It uses React Router for navigation and MUI for styling.

We will be using the following api: https://dummyjson.com/docs/recipes#recipes-single for the recipe page, and we will be doing this together.

## Tasks:

- [ ] Create a new page for the home page
- [ ] Use the MUI theme to create a custom theme
- [ ] Use axios to fetch data from the api: https://fakestoreapi.com/products similar to the recipe page.
- [ ] Correctly set the types for the api data - Ensure you use all of the data types
- [ ] Use MUI card component to display the products and style it
- [ ] Add a search bar to the products page
